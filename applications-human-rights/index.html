This series will discuss real world applications of earth observation
technology for international development:

**Jeremy Hale** will kick off the series discussing the solar powered High Altitude
Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) program. He will highlight what HAPS means for a larger
trend of remote sensing advancements and how it will impact accessibility and
affordability of remote sensing data for international development.

**Amit Kapadia** will talk about discuss why accessible and open imagery is key to
empowering the global development community with the data and tools they need
to combat issues like climate change, deforestation, and food security. He will
also touch upon Planet Labs' recent work with the United Nations and donation
of imagery towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

**Ian Schuler** will talk about why open source tools for processing and
distributing imagery matter. He will highlight how OpenAerialMap has been used
for searching for and circulating drone imagery for use in the development
industry.
