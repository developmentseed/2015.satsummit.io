This series will give an overview of the current state of the Earth Observation
sector:

**Carrissa Christensen** will discuss the size and growth of the satellite
industry, key players, trends and expected advancements in observation
capabilities. She'll also touch on things that limit the expansion of earth
observation, such as financing, launch capacity and engineering challenges.

**Chris Biddy** will present on the state of the art in building small
satellites and how recent advancements have changed the cost and time of the
production cycle. He will also discuss his efforts to open source the hardware
design and the regulatory challenges in doing so.

**Kevin Bullock** will talk about what goes into producing high quality, high
resolution imagery and why it's difficult, but necessary, to get georeferencing
and atmospheric correction right. He will also highlight what infrastructure is
needed to process, and manage large volumes of heavy data.

**Marc Prioleau** will cap off the series with a brief overview of what the
state of the industry means for development organizations.
