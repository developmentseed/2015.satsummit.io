**Camilla Mahon** will walk us through processing capabilities and techniques
for turning raw data into usable imagery. She will also discuss the critical
role processing has in the distribution cycle and and how this barrier can
impact development organizations' ability to use imagery.

**Jed Sundwall** will discuss the challenge of consolidating, storing and
sharing massive amounts of remote sensing data. He will also discuss Amazon Web
Servicesâ€™s Open Data initiative, how they're collecting open imagery sources
and making them readily available for development organizations.

**Bronwyn Agrios** and **Drew Bollinger** will wrap up with a presentation on
their platform collaboration, how it can change the way we gain access to 
satellite imagery, and its applications for development.
