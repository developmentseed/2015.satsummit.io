The global development community and satellite companies stand to benefit
immensely from shared understanding of needs and capabilities. Development
organizations will need to retool and rethink their practices to best take
advantage. Satellite companies are interested in supporting the work of
development organizations, but they lack detailed strategy and insight into the
needs of development and humanitarian communities. This panel will discuss how
altering perspectives and methods can lead to better collaboration between
practitioners and providers.
