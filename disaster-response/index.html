Recent natural disasters and humanitarian crises have highlighted how
collaboration between the satellite industry and aid organizations can result
in improved access to information in the critical hours of a response. These
collaborations have produced imagery under liberal licenses and allowed many
actors access to information. This panel will discuss how the growth of the
satellite industry can improve response efforts, produce better data, and
expedite distribution to those on the ground.
